# BrightFlux-Plugin-Reports 

This plugin will implement a convenient way to generate reports from templates
and block-templates. 

## Idea 

The idea is to re-implement a former template engine concept and build different
types of reports actually from the same data, but maybe without some technical
details.

Why are different reports necessary? Because Log-Analysis evidence must be
presented on different levels of understanding. We often need decisions on
project level and sometimes we want to make our colleagues to understand.
Both need a different kind of presentation and different types of information
in different level of technical depth. An analysis and this report generator 
should make it easy to present and retrieve and generate the information for
different audiences.
