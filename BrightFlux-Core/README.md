# BrightFlux-Core

This is project will host the code for data ingestion, data processing, data annotation and data serving.

## Idea

Provide some performant? access to the logdata to analyze, using filters and pipes. Since This is meant 
to be working in readonly mode on the data I might want to at least support some kind of project file, 
which helps to access the data in a desired way. I also want to create an index, and reformat the data 
and store this reformatted data partitioned. So this code contains the data process 

## What this project is not right now.

I won't claim this to be the most performant code... and i don't care enough for raw
It will probably not host the code for viewing the data, as this is secondary for me at the moment.
