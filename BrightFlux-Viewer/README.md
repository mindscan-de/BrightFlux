# BrightFlux-Viewer

This is project will implement the Logfile-Viewer. Keep in mind that this is just a spare time
side project of mine.

## Idea

The Idea is basically to have a GUI, where the log files can be viewed and analyzed. I didn't 
meant to start the GUI that early, but I really like the end-to-end experience. But this also 
means, that the project will look very unsatisfying for a long time. But because I want to see
the content of the data frames and I don't want to stick to writing them back to text files, I 
decided to start with the simplest application possible - to present a single data frame only.

I will probably even delete it and restart from scratch if I'm not satisfied with the outcome,
but for now I prefer the end-to-end experience over the usability. The end-to-end approach also
helps to focus and develop the right and smallest feature for the next improvement. Things can
be refactored and improved as we go.
  
Also I'm not a GUI-guy, therefore do not expect me to do something fancy right now. Maybe later.

## MVP

That all said, this "Viewer" should be able to load, ingest and present exactly one file 
"heart.csv".
