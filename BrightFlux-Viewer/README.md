# BrightFlux-Viewer

This is project will implement the Logfile-Viewer

## Idea

The Idea basically is to have a GUI, where the log files can be viewed and analyzed. I didn't 
meant to start the GUI that early, but I really like the end-to-end experience. But this also 
means, that the project will look very unsatisfying for a long time. But becaue I want to see
the content of the data frames and I don't want to stick to writing them to text files again,
I decided to start with the simplest application possible.

I will possibly even delete it and restart start from scratch if I'm not satisfied with the 
outcome, but for now I prefer the end-to-end experience over usability.
